# 💡 Multilingual Startup Funding Intelligence Copilot

> A Generative AI–based assistant that helps Indian startup founders access **startup funding information** in **Indic languages** through a chat-based interface.

## 🚀 About the Project

Startup funding information in India is scattered across reports, government PDFs, and websites, and is mostly available only in English.

This project aims to **democratize access to startup funding knowledge** by providing a **ChatGPT-like AI assistant** that delivers **clear, explainable, and source-backed answers** to funding-related questions.
